Need two separate folders for:
- resource pack, and
- behavior pack

The resource pack is going to be where the audio/visual aspects of added blocks (e.g., textures; this is not including the model) and can include localization strings, texture mapping, etc.  The behavior pack is where the block will be created/registered and can include other behaviors.
